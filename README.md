# Emotions Detection

## Overview
Emotions Detection is an AI-based system that analyzes facial expressions and classifies them into different emotions. The system uses deep learning techniques to process images and detect emotions accurately.

## Features
- Image-based emotion detection
- Supports multiple emotions (e.g., happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc.)
- Provides confidence scores for predictions
- Uses deep learning for accurate classification
- Can be integrated into real-time applications

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- Kaggle API (for dataset retrieval)


## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plant-disease-detection.git
   cd plant-disease-detection
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Download the dataset from Kaggle:

  - Upload your Kaggle API key (kaggle.json) in the notebook.
  - Run the dataset download cell.
    
4. Run the model training:
   ```bash
   python train.py
5. Start the web application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
## Dataset
The project uses a labeled dataset from Kaggle containing images of faces with different emotions. The dataset is preprocessed and augmented for better training results.

## Model Training
- Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for emotion classification.
- Random seed is initialized for reproducibility.
- Data augmentation is applied to improve model performance.
- Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Usage
1. Upload an image of a face.
2. The AI model will analyze facial expressions and detect the corresponding emotion.
3. The system will display the predicted emotion along with a confidence score.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with a mobile app for real-time emotion detection.
- More emotion categories added to improve classification.
- AI-powered emotion analysis for video streams.
